Uh just download this code and run it in your IDE, if you dont have an IDE i recommend Thonny. 
To use this game in Thonny, download Pygame by clicking on the tool bar on the top left bar, 
click manage plug-ins, 
type Pygame in the searchbar, 
install it,
And finally paste the code into Thonny and run it.
